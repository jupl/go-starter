** go-bindata
Use [[https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata][go-bindata]] to bundle static assets. [[https://blog.codeship.com/embedding-assets-in-go/][Take advantage of go generate]] for automation. It is recommended to have built assets =bindata.go= next to an =assets/= directory. Take advantage of ~go generate~ with a neighboring file called =assets.go= next to =assets/=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
//go:generate go-bindata -pkg $GOPACKAGE assets
#+END_EXAMPLE


** TODO Make


** Docker
A =Dockerfile= is included to build [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] images. Use =PACKAGE= argument to specify which binary to build. Example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
docker build --build-arg PACKAGE=app -t app .
#+END_EXAMPLE

To run tests only:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
docker build --target test -t test .
#+END_EXAMPLE
