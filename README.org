* [WIP] go-starter
Personal boilerplate starter.


** Make
To see which commands are available simply run ~make~. With the provided =Makefile= the following is available:
- Check for file changes when running commands.
- A file =bindata.go= is automatically generated next to directories called =assets/= using [[https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata][go-bindata]].
- Any =.proto= files are automatically generated using [[https://github.com/google/protobuf][protobuf]].


** Docker
A =Dockerfile= is included to build [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] images. Make sure to change ~WORKDIR~. Use =PACKAGE= argument to specify which binary to build. Example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
docker build --build-arg PACKAGE=app -t app .
#+END_EXAMPLE

To run tests only:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
docker build --target test -t test .
#+END_EXAMPLE
