Personal boilerplate starter.


** TODO About


** TODO Project structure


** go-bindata
Use [[https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata][go-bindata]] to bundle static assets. [[https://blog.codeship.com/embedding-assets-in-go/][Take advantage of go generate]] for automation. It is recommended to name built assets =bindata.go= so it does not get included in source control.


** Docker
A =Dockerfile= is included to build [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] images. Use =PACKAGE= argument to specify which binary to build. Example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
docker build --build-arg PACKAGE=app -t app .
#+END_EXAMPLE
